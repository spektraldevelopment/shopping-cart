# Shopping Cart

This is a basic shopping cart POC done in React/Typescript on the Front End and using Node/Express for the Back End. The POC features a localStorage fallback in case the server can't be reached for some reason.

## Getting started

Front End - In the root directory run 

`npm install` 

followed by 

`npm run dev`

Back End - In a separate terminal `cd` into the `server` directory 

and run 

`npm install` 

followed by 

`npm run dev`

> Note: You need to run the server at least once in order to set the localStorage object.
